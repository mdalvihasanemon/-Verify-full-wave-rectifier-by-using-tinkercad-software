1. Create the Circuit on TinkerCad
Open TinkerCad: Start by logging into TinkerCad (www.tinkercad.com) and opening the "Circuits" section.
Components Needed:
4 Diodes (for the bridge rectifier)
1 AC Voltage Source (Sine wave)
1 Resistor (to limit current)
Oscilloscope (to observe the waveform)
Breadboard (optional but helpful for organizing the circuit)
2. Full-Wave Rectifier Circuit Design:
Bridge Rectifier Setup:
Arrange the 4 diodes in the classic bridge rectifier configuration:
Two diodes (D1, D2) with their anodes connected to the positive side of the AC supply.
Two diodes (D3, D4) with their cathodes connected to the negative side of the AC supply.
The other ends of D1 and D3 connect together as one output (positive terminal), and the other ends of D2 and D4 connect together as the second output (negative terminal).
Connect the AC voltage source across the bridge rectifier input.
Place a resistor as a load across the output of the bridge rectifier.
Add an oscilloscope to the output of the circuit to measure and visualize the waveform.
3. Simulation:
Start the Simulation: Click the "Start Simulation" button in TinkerCad.
View the Output Waveform:
Use the oscilloscope to observe the waveform across the load resistor.
You should observe a full-wave rectified output, meaning that both the positive and negative halves of the AC input waveform have been converted to positive pulses at the output.
4. Expected Output:
The oscilloscope should display a continuous positive waveform, with pulses during both the positive and negative half cycles of the input AC signal.
This is characteristic of a full-wave rectification, where both halves of the AC signal are utilized.
5. Save Your Work:
Capture a screenshot of your circuit and waveform.
You can also download the oscilloscope data from TinkerCad for further analysis.
